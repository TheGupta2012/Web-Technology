        <p> <b><em> Don't you have time to think </em></b> is a collection of letters from the
        legend Richard Feynman himself to his colleagues, loved ones and most notably his fans.  These letters
         span his lifetime, from his letters when he first left his parents to study at Princeton and MIT,
         to his love and wife Arline, and later to Gweneth among the many letters he wrote.</p>

         <p>His willingness and excitement to communicate the most complex of problems in the simplest
         of analogies is evident when he responds to small students, and awkward fan mails from the orient.
          A person is not just what is described by the press, or by his autobiographies, or by his
          friends and family, no, the world is much bigger than that! We meet far more people than that
          and we touch many lives, in some way. What these people think of us, and how we touched them is
          a much larger picture. This book, is an example of how he fared and to me, he was phenomenal. And
          that is not it, he still continues to inspire people, like he inspires me. Ironically, he also authored
           ‘What do you care what other people think?’ but there is no conflict.</p>

          <p>Richard was imbibed with the ideas of curiosity, questioning and the nature of inquiry from a very young
               age by his father. He had a very special kind of relation with his father. At a young age
              of 3, his father would initiate him into the symmetry and patterns of mathematics, and as Richard recalls,
               his father would sit Richard down on the lap, and read to him from the Encyclopedia Britannica, and then would
                imagine with him, what was just said. The visualizing of a problem in very tangible examples was something his
                father instilled in him. (It shouldn't be too surprising to know that he explained a complex theory of Quantum Electrodynamics
                 by visualizable diagrams, now called Feynman diagrams. It was for this, that he got the Nobel prize.)
