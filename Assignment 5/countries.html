                 of NCT Delhi. New Delhi is also the seat of all three branches of
                 the Government of India, that is Executive (Rashtrapati Bhavan), Legislature (Parliament House)
                and Judiciary (Supreme Court of India). It was designed by British architects Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker. The new capital was inaugurated on 13 February 1931,
      by Viceroy and Governor-General of India Lord Irwin.
    Although colloquially Delhi and New Delhi are used interchangeably to refer to the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT),
    these are two distinct entities, with New Delhi forming a small part of the city of Delhi. The National Capital Region is a much larger
    entity comprising the entire NCT along with adjoining districts in neighbouring states.</span>
